   abstract = {This chapter examines the uses of machine learning (ML) in applying genomic technologies to cancer research and treatment. It provides a brief overview of genomic technologies that have impacted cancer research as well as the use of ML in bringing these technologies into clinical practice. It further reviews some notable successes in translating ML and genomics into improvements in the practice of cancer treatment, as well as some current directions in ML for cancer genomics. It then considers common challenges to applying ML methods for cancer genomics and some general strategies for overcoming these challenges in practice. It concludes with a perspective on potential future directions for ML in cancer genomics and how these may impact the future of cancer treatment.},
